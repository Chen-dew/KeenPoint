      "summary": "This section introduces the problem of deploying computationally expensive CNNs on resource-limited edge devices, emphasizing the need for filter pruning to achieve model compression and acceleration. It categorizes existing filter pruning methods into property importance (e.g., based on sparsity, norms, gradients) and adaptive importance (e.g., involving loss modification and joint optimization), highlighting their trade-offs in efficiency and theoretical guidance. The proposed HRank method addresses these limitations by using the high rank of feature maps as a property importance based pruner, motivated by the empirical observation that feature map ranks are consistent across inputs. HRank eliminates the need for additional constraints or retraining, simplifies pruning complexity, and is claimed to outperform state-of-the-art methods in compression and acceleration ratios.",

It categorizes filter pruning into property importance approaches (e.g., based on ℓ₁-norm or sparsity) and adaptive importance approaches (e.g., using optimization or regression with constraints). Low-rank decomposition is discussed as an alternative method that approximates weights to reduce computation but may incur accuracy loss under high compression. The discussion compares filter pruning favorably over weight pruning for reducing model complexity and hardware compatibility, while noting inefficiencies in existing methods. It positions the proposed HRank method as orthogonal to low-rank decomposition, emphasizing its focus on the rank of feature maps rather than decomposing filters, and suggests potential integration for higher compression.",

It is empirically observed that the expectation of ranks generated by a single filter is robust to input images, with negligible variance, allowing approximation using a small batch of images (e.g., g=500). This enables the derivation of a tractable optimization objective (Eq. 6) that minimizes by pruning filters with the least average ranks.
